Usage: mylist [-rglhv] [arg1] [arg2] [arg3] ...

  An implementation of ls.
  It takes a list of command line arguments and list each arguments. If the
  argument is a directory, it will list all the entries in that directory.
  Otherwise it will list that file. There are three major options -g, -l and -r.
  -g and -l are mutex, which means only one of -g and -l can be applied. If
  both are given -g will be ignored. -g is the default option.
  If there is no command line arguments, current directory will be listed.
  The output of each argument should be separated by a line of '='.
  There should be a title line for option -l.
   	-g or --general: list file name only, in lexical order. There are 100
   	                 columns in each row, and two spaces between each column. 
  	                 The width of column is the length of longest file name.
   	                 The sort order is up to down, then left to right.
   	-l or --list: list all information about a file, each file a line,
	              including:
		      PERM  SIZE  USR GRP MD TYPE
   	-r or --recursive: list each subdirectory recursively.
   	-h or --help: display help info
   	-v or --verison: display version info, author info and copyright info.
